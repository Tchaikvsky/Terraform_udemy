# Terraform_udemy

This is a place where I store my work done while working on the terraform udemy course I enrolled in.
I'm not 100% sure yet whether I'll be doing much hands on work yet but I'm hoping to do as much as possible
and store it here.

My ultimate goal is to get really comfortable with Terraform as it's an incredible fun and important tool
for DevOps Engineers at the moment. By the end of this course, I plan to take the Terraform certification
test.

Wish me luck!
